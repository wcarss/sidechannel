# Sidechannel
## sidechannel is for telling jokes.

It's not okay to whisper jokes when you're supposed to be paying attention to someone in a group -- like in class, or a presentation, or a big meeting -- but it's fine to glance at your phone.

We're missing a lot of hilarious opportunities here, and sidechannel fixes that. It's giggles at a glance.
